# Create a function for each of the four questions below: 

""" Question 1:
	# Given a string and a non-negative int n, return a larger string that is n copies of the original string.
	# Examples: 
		string_times('Hi', 2) → 'HiHi'
		string_times('Hi', 3) → 'HiHiHi'
		string_times('Hi', 1) → 'Hi'
"""

""" Question 2: Given an array of integers, return True if 6 appears as either 
	the first or last element in the array. The array will be length 1 or more.
	Examples: 
		first_last6([1, 2, 6]) → True
		first_last6([6, 1, 2, 3]) → True
		first_last6([13, 6, 1, 2, 3]) → False
"""

""" Question 3: Given an array of ints, return True if the array is length 1 or 
	more, and the first element and the last element are equal.
	Examples:
		same_first_last([1, 2, 3]) → False
		same_first_last([1, 2, 3, 1]) → True
		same_first_last([1, 2, 1]) → True
