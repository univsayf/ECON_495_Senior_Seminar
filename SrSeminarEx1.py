# Question 1: Create a list using the variable below (follow the same order as below). Name list "new_list."
x = 1
y = 0
z = 2

# Question 2: Import the package called "numpy"

# Create a variable named "variable1" that produces a numpy array as follows: [2 4 6]

# Create a variable named "variable2" that produces a numpy array as follows: [2 True False]

# Complete the following line of codes to produce an output as follows: [4 5 6]

print(variable1 ? variable2)

# Work with "pandas" lybrary. Below I am importing pandas library 
import pandas as pd

# Use the following link to download a dataset: https://github.com/univsayf/ECON_495_Senior_Seminar/blob/master/wage_data.csv.zip

# Below I have provoded the codes to load the data set. Run the code.
df = pd.read_csv('wage_data.csv') 

# the following code gives a list of columns available in a dataset
list(df)

# You can extract a column of a dataframe/dataset by using the following command: df.column_name
# Your task is use functions of numpy arrays to give the following statistics: mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, and median.
